Hey there :v:

I am  :bowtie: an interdisciplinary researcher :smiling_imp: and am boldly using metaphors :notes: from biology and physics in my works such as fitness landscapes, evolutionary algorithms, swarm intelligence, gravity theory, etc. My research interests take place in three domains; _Operations management_ (supply chain management, complexity in operations, etc.), _Operations research_ (decision processes, queuing systems, simulation, etc.) and _Information systems_ (knowledge management, artificial agents, theoretical foundations of information, etc.)
